# Flowers-CNN
A notebook that confronts the flowers classification problem using tensorflow and techniques like data-augmentation, dropout and transfer learning.
That repository has two different notebooks. One is called 'Trabajo_DL_antpecgil,' which is a notebook I created for the Artificial Intelligence Amplification, a 3rd-course subject. The other notebook, 'Proyecto_CNN,' is a summary of the previous one. 
That project received a 9/10 rating.
